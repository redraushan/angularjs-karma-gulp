## Intstallation

* `npm intall`

## Running test

This sample project illustrates 2 usage scenarios of Karma integration in the Gulp.js build:

* `gulp test` - a task that runs all the tests with Karma once and exits. Such a task is often used on CI servers etc.

* `gulp tdd` - a task that runs the tests and pauses, watching for file changes. Upon detecting a change Karma re-runs the tests. Such a task is often used during development.
